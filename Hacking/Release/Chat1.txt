Hello
Emad Hamdy
My shuttle is break down on your planet and I don't know how to fix it.
It's "13-13-2013-EARTH".
Okay, just a moment please.
I did like what you said but nothing happend!
I did and all the wires are in the right place.
Actually, I joined your latest offer "Unlimited Gasoline" from a month and since then my shutlle's speed became very slow and when I woke up today I found that it isn't working.
It's still after 2 days.
Alright.
Yes!
It wasn't lighting before but now, it's.
Okay.
Yes, it's.
That's great. Would you need any more services, sir?
No, thank you.
Goodbye!
